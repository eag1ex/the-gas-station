## Developer notes

- we need to implement base route `api` to allow child routes and to separate logic
- we need to add ORM possibly prism.
  - this will require SQLITE as our database
  - we will need pre/populate database option also to generate default setting
- we will need more tests for these options, and we will need to cover all code base
- make sure we are building for the latest version on js
